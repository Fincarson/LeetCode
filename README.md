# LeetCode

This repository is my personal **LeetCode practice log**: solutions, notes, and patterns I want to remember.
The goal is to keep everything **searchable, structured, and easy to expand** over time.

## !!! DISCLAIMER !!!
- Solutions here may not be the only (or best) approach—treat them as **reference**.
- I do not condone academic dishonesty. Do not submit others’ work as your own.
- For interview prep: understand the idea first, then implement independently.
