## Problem

In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

### Example 1

```text
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > 'Ã¢Ë†â€¦', where 'Ã¢Ë†â€¦' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= words.length <= 100
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
- order.length == 26
- All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.

<summary><strong>Java</strong></summary>

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAlienSorted(String[] words, String order) {
        int[] orderMap = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < order.length(); i++){
            orderMap[order.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {

            for (int j = 0; j < words[i].length(); j++) {
                // If we do not find a mismatch letter between words[i] and words[i + 1],
                // we need to examine the case when words are like ("apple", "app").
                if (j >= words[i + 1].length()) return false;

                if (words[i].charAt(j) != words[i + 1].charAt(j)) {
int currentWordChar = words[i].charAt(j) - 'a';
int nextWordChar = words[i + 1].charAt(j) - 'a';
                    if (orderMap[currentWordChar] > orderMap[nextWordChar]) return false;
                    // if we find the first different letter and they are sorted,
                    // then there's no need to check remaining letters
                    else break;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
