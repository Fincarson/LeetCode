**Problem Link:** [LeetCode 943 - Find the Shortest Superstring](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-shortest-superstring/)

## Problem

Given an array of strings words, return the smallest string that contains each string in words as a substring. If there are multiple valid strings of the smallest length, return any of them.

You may assume that no string in words is a substring of another string in words.

### Example 1

```text
Input: words = ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
Output: "alexlovesleetcode"
Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: words = ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= words.length <= 12
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
- words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of words are unique.
