## Problem

Given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of pancake flips.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

- Choose an integer k where 1 <= k <= arr.length.
- Reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).

For example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.

Return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort arr. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * arr.length flips will be judged as correct.

### Example 1

```text
Input: arr = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation:
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= arr.length <= 100
- 1 <= arr[i] <= arr.length
- All integers in arr are unique (i.e. arr is a permutation of the integers from 1 to arr.length).

### Implementation

<summary><strong>Java</strong></summary>

```java
class Solution {
    /**
     * sort like bubble-sort i.e. sink the largest number to the bottom at each round.
     */
    public List<Integer> pancakeSort(int[] A) {
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int valueToSort = A.length; valueToSort > 0; valueToSort--) {
            // locate the position for the value to sort in this round
            int index = this.find(A, valueToSort);

            // sink the value_to_sort to the bottom,
            // with at most two steps of pancake flipping.
            if (index == valueToSort - 1)
                continue;
            // 1). flip the value to the head if necessary
            if (index != 0) {
                ans.add(index + 1);
                this.flip(A, index + 1);
            }
            // 2). now that the value is at the head, flip it to the bottom
            ans.add(valueToSort);
            this.flip(A, valueToSort);
        }

        return ans;
    }

    protected void flip(int[] sublist, int k) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < k / 2) {
            int temp = sublist[i];
            sublist[i] = sublist[k - i - 1];
            sublist[k - i - 1] = temp;
            i += 1;
        }
    }

    protected int find(int[] a, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++)
            if (a[i] == target)
                return i;
        return -1;
    }
